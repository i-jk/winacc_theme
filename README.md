WinACC Theme
============

A flat, responsive, Panopoly-enhanced sub-theme of Radix for WinACC.

- by Jim Kirkpatrick - www.i-jk.co.uk
- for Winchester Action on Climate Change - www.winacc.org.uk

---

Shamelessly includes some great improvements to nav, tabs and menu
structure from Kalatheme, and the awesome flatness of Flatly by
BootSwatch. From here WinACC's colours and design was overlaid, then I
dropped some custom grooviness on top. And a cherry.
